# Emergency-Landing-for-a-Quadrotor-Without-Using-Marker

The main purpose of the project was to help develop a drone landing mode and develop the landing place autonomously in the case of emergency. For example, rain, fire, strong wind, or in major cases when the droneâ€™s engine may fail, it would survive with minimum possible damage. Morphological operations and edge detection method have been used. My duty was to implement image processing algorithms. So, I used Python,Opencv, morphological operations and edge detection in order to identify whether or not there was an object in the landing area. If it recognises any object is in the landing area, it would change its direction to the other area that is available for landing.
