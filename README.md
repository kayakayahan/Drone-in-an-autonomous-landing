# Emergency-Landing-for-a-Quadrotor-Without-Using-Marker
Autonomous Landing for a quadrotor in case of emergency situation without using marker

The main purpose of the project is to make the drone landing mode and determine the landing place autonomously in cases of emergency such as rain, fire, strong wind or in cases of emergency where the drone's engine fails. In this way, the drone will be freed from the emergency with the least possible damage. Python and OpenCV were used for this system. With OpenCV, Morphological operations and edge detection method have been used, then objects in the landing area have been identified and the possibility of landing in a non-object location has been provided.
